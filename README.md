# MyTask Explanations

## Demo

## Time Cost

- I have no knowledge of blockchain development, so I spent a lot of time to understand things like wallet, network, hotkey, etc. and to resolve issues like using "test" as the network and registering before stake/unstake.
- I haven't been using Redis in Python since asyncio is commonly used. I tried aiocache to build the cache. However it cannot work with the official documentation, and I went through some code and the quality doesn't seem to be good. Finally I implemented the cache (`mytask.common.redis_cache`) by myself. The project under same organization _aioredis_ is not good as well. (I don't understand _aio-libs_ not maintaining projects well)
- I was a bit hurry about the timeline, so I was relying more on the AI than usual, but finally I have to fix it one by one.
- My network seems to be slow to run Bittensor. For example, every connection to Bittensor network will cost 7+ seconds. I can improve it in the future.

## Technical Design and Decisions

- Overall it's a common FastAPI project
  - `routers` for APIs
  - `models` for database models and API models
  - `services` for external services
  - `tables` for database operations
- I choosed Postgres as the database and SQLAlchemy as the ORM framework. SQLModel seems to be convenient, but it doesn't have good support to all database features like JSONB.
- I created a common CRUD class (`mytask.common.table`) for tables, and it can be extended by inheriting.
- Cache design:
  - Cache all netuids
  - Cache dividends:
    ```python
        def _make_cache_key(self, netuid: int | None, hotkey: str | None) -> str:
        # both none
        if netuid is None and hotkey is None:
            return "all"
        # netuids none
        if netuid is None:
            return f"hotkey:{hotkey}"
        # hotkey none
        if hotkey is None:
            return f"netuid:{netuid}"
        # both not none
        return f"netuid:{netuid},hotkey:{hotkey}"
    ```

## Final Words

Actually I exceeded the time limit. Except for the Bittensor part. The timeline (9 hours) seems to be just OK to me to finish the project and make it running well.

Small reference to count the project.
